# FreeCodeCamp-TributePage
I'm starting my very first project with the knowledge that I have.

1 hour later: I just loved the result, but i think it looks like the original way too much. Well I'm starting now so I think is fine. 

Well, I finished this project very fast, but still I could improve my CSS grid skills, and HTML semantics. I am happy with the result and I hope I get even better as the time goes.

I know is very silly but hey if you wanna see the preview, or give me some hints I would really love that. :)

Here it is the preview: https://codepen.io/tysper013/full/QWvodOP
